Welcome to the Sports Cards JSON Repository, your ultimate destination for exploring sports card data in a structured and open-source format. This repository features comprehensive datasets for baseball cards, football cards, basketball cards, and hockey cards in a developer-friendly JSON format. Collectors, developers, and enthusiasts can use this resource to power their projects such as:

* Integrating a complete sports card database into web applications
* Building mobile apps with powerful search across MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL card collections
* Training machine learning models on structured sports memorabilia data
* Managing personal card collections with accurate checklists

## Why This Repository?

The Sports Cards JSON Repository addresses the gap in freely accessible, high-quality sports card datasets. By providing open data, we empower developers to:

* Create innovative tools for sports card collectors
* Develop offline applications for managing and analyzing card collections
* Use structured data for building machine learning models or generating insights
* Access comprehensive metadata about card sets across multiple sports

Whether you're working on a trading card tracker, a sports card price guide, or exploring trends in sports memorabilia, this repository offers a solid foundation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by sports categories with releases organized by year:

## Data Schema Structure

### Category Files

Each sport has a category file (e.g., `baseball.json`) defining available years and releases:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "category": {
    "name": "Baseball Cards",
    "years": [
      {
        "year": "1990",
        "releases": [
          {
            "name": "Topps Baseball",
            "indexed": true,
            "version": "1.0",
            "uniqueId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
          },
          {
